# Model Semantics and Runtime Injection

This guide owns the boundary between AI resource credentials, model semantics,
Workspace model selection, and native Agent runtime configuration. Read it
before changing provider presets, Workspace AI defaults, model capability
fields, or the Claude Code, Codex, opencode, and Pi provider injectors.

## The Three-Layer Contract

OpenAlice does not run an in-process model loop. It prepares a native Agent CLI
to reach a selected model. That preparation has three distinct inputs:

```text
Credential access
  account/vendor + key/auth + region + supported wire endpoints
                         │
                         ▼
Model selection and semantic resolution
  model id + known limits/capabilities + explicit unknown-model overrides
                         │
                         ▼
Native runtime projection
  Claude Code / Codex / opencode / Pi configuration and reversible ownership
```

### Credential access

A credential answers **how the user may reach an AI resource**. It owns the
secret, authentication kind, vendor identity, and the wire-shape-to-endpoint
map accepted by that key. It does not own a model's capabilities.

`Credential.lastModel` is a remembered selection hint. It saves the user from
retyping the last model used with an account, but it does not make the model an
intrinsic property of the credential and must never store a copied capability
snapshot.

### Model selection and semantics

A selection answers **which model the Workspace should use**. The model
registry resolves a known `(vendor, model id)` into stable semantic facts such
as context/output limits and reasoning behavior. Agent adapters consume that
resolved result; UI forms must not ask users to rediscover known facts.

Model semantics are tri-state. A missing field means **unknown**, not false.
This matters for free-typed model ids and private gateways: writing a false
capability can disable a runtime's own model detection, while omitting an
unknown capability preserves the native fallback.

Reasoning is not one universal API field. The registry describes behavior:

- `none`: the model does not expose a reasoning mode;
- `optional`: reasoning is supported and may be enabled or disabled;
- `adaptive`: the model chooses whether/how much to reason, influenced by
  effort;
- `required`: the model rejects requests that disable or omit reasoning.

Effort levels, defaults, and interleaved reasoning are separate facts. The
registry must not collapse them back into one boolean merely because Pi and
opencode currently accept a coarse `reasoning` capability bit.

### Native runtime projection

An injector answers **how the selected resource and model preference are
expressed in one Agent runtime**. It maps a shared resolved binding into the
runtime's native format:

- Pi custom model metadata and native project selection;
- opencode model capabilities, limits, provider package, and variants;
- Claude Code endpoint/auth/model settings while preserving its native model
  catalog and effort defaults;
- Codex endpoint/auth/model and wire API settings.

The runtime remains the owner of unspecified policy. OpenAlice does not choose
an effort level just because a model supports effort. A user preference may be
projected when explicit; otherwise the Agent's native default and global
fallback remain in force.

## Registry Ownership

`src/ai-providers/model-semantics.ts` is the curated, offline semantic registry.
`src/ai-providers/preset-catalog.ts` owns the provider/model suggestions and
attaches exact registry matches to those model records. Model lists remain
suggestions rather than allowlists: every model field keeps free-text entry.

The serialized preset contract exposes model records directly to the UI.
JSON Schema continues to describe form validation, but it is not the semantic
database. A single resolver owns exact-id/alias matching and the unknown-model
fallback so the UI, Workspace defaults, and injectors cannot drift.

The registry is repository data, not persisted user state. Updating a known
model changes future resolution but must not silently rewrite existing
Workspace files. Existing configurations change only through their normal
explicit apply/create paths.

An upstream catalog such as Models.dev may later generate part of this table at
build time. OpenAlice-specific overrides still own protocol quirks and runtime
compatibility, and Workspace launch must not depend on a live catalog fetch.

## User Experience

For a registered model, the normal flow asks for account/region/key/model and
derives capability fields automatically. The UI may summarize the result but
must not require a reasoning checkbox or context-window guess for known facts.

For an unknown free-typed model, the runtime fallback is the default. Advanced
overrides remain available for facts OpenAlice cannot discover. An override is
bound to the selected model id (`reasoningModel` in creation defaults); changing
models must not carry an old model's capability assertion forward invisibly.

Connection probes verify that a key, endpoint, wire shape, and model can answer.
They do not prove the complete capability set. Error-guided retries (for
example, a model that mandates thinking) are useful diagnostics but do not
replace the curated registry.

## Configuration Ownership and Reset

Agent configuration files may also contain user- or runtime-owned settings.
Injectors must update only OpenAlice-owned keys/nodes, preserve unknown data,
and restore the prior value on reset where a shared scalar is overridden.

Pi uses a namespaced global provider plus project binding/rollback state.
Claude Code and opencode use the same lifecycle rule with
`.claude/openalice-provider.json` and `.opencode/openalice-provider.json`:
the first write snapshots only the nodes OpenAlice will replace, later writes
retain that original snapshot, and reset restores a node only if it still equals
the last injected value. A user edit or whole-file deletion made after injection
wins. Codex is the
exception because its Workspace `.codex/` is an intentionally exclusive
`CODEX_HOME`, not a shared project-config layer.

The rollback sidecars can contain prior or injected secrets and are therefore
sensitive Workspace state. Templates must exclude both sidecars and native
provider config files from git. They must never be logged or copied into test
snapshots.

Secrets remain excluded from git and logs. Semantic registry entries never
contain credentials.

## Load-Bearing Paths

- `src/ai-providers/preset-catalog.ts` — built-in providers and model records.
- `src/ai-providers/model-semantics.ts` — exact semantic resolution and runtime-neutral binding inputs.
- `src/ai-providers/presets.ts` — backend-to-UI preset serialization.
- `src/core/config.ts` — credential access and creation-time Workspace defaults.
- `src/workspaces/credential-injection.ts` — credential + selection + semantics composition.
- `src/workspaces/adapters/` — native runtime projection and round-trip parsing.
- `ui/src/components/credentials/` — credential/account setup.
- `ui/src/components/workspace/WorkspaceAIConfigModal.tsx` — per-Workspace selection and unknown-model overrides.

## Verification Invariants

Tests for this subsystem must cover:

- every built-in vendor default resolves to a registered model;
- exact ids and declared aliases resolve, while unknown ids remain unknown;
- omitted semantic fields do not become false during serialization;
- registered reasoning models reach Pi and opencode without a manual toggle;
- non-reasoning and unknown models do not receive fabricated capabilities;
- model changes cannot retain a capability override for the previous id;
- adapter write/read/write round trips preserve semantic fields;
- reset removes only OpenAlice-owned configuration and restores prior values;
- credential secrets never appear in logs, docs, committed fixtures, or test snapshots;
- sensitive rollback sidecars remain excluded from git alongside native provider config.

## Registry Maintenance

Add a semantic fact only when provider documentation or a reproducible live
compatibility check supports it. Record the source beside the registry data.
If public surfaces disagree, omit that field and preserve the unknown state;
for example, GLM 5.2 reasoning is registered while its disputed context limit
is deliberately absent.

When a provider changes a model in place, update the registry and its unit
tests together. Existing Workspace files are not rewritten in the background;
the new facts apply on the next explicit provider apply or Workspace creation.
