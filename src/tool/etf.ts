 * etfSearch / etfGetInfo / etfGetHoldings / etfGetSectors:
 *   thin bridge to the openTypeBB etf-router endpoints. Lets the agent
 *   self-serve thematic ETFs — find a theme's ETF, then read whether the
 *   theme actually attracted capital (the reflexivity read; see etfGetInfo).
 *
 * Provider note: ETF search is FMP-only; ETF info is served by yfinance
 * (keyless) which also carries the reflexivity fields (total_assets /
 * category / inception_date / volume_avg). Holdings/sectors prefer FMP
 * (full holdings list) and FALL BACK to yfinance keylessly — top-10
 * holdings + full sector weights via quoteSummary — so an FMP outage or
 * missing key degrades instead of going dark.

Use this to locate the ETF(s) for a specific theme (e.g. "robotics", "uranium",
"cybersecurity", "semiconductors") — the broad GICS sector ETFs are handled
elsewhere; this is for going one level deeper into a specific theme.

Reflexivity read: the *existence* of a thematic ETF means an issuer judged the
theme had enough capital behind it to support a fund — a market-validated
signal. But that signal is coarse and LATE (thematic ETFs cluster near theme
peaks). After finding candidates, call etfGetInfo to gauge how much capital
actually showed up (AUM × volume) before trusting the theme.`,

(total_assets), NAV, and average volume.

This is the reflexivity gauge for a theme. Existence is binary; capital is
graded — read it as a thermometer, not a switch:
- AUM × dollar volume = how much money the theme actually attracted. High on
  both = real; low AUM + thin volume = a zombie ETF = a bet that did NOT pay
  off = an anti-signal for the theme.
- A young inception_date (< ~1 year) on a fund already trading heavy = the
  theme is in its reflexive acceleration phase — the most interesting case.
- Caveat: thematic ETFs launch near theme tops and on average underperform
  after launch. Treat all of this as right-side confirmation / an attention
  radar, NOT as early alpha.
